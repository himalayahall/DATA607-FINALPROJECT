# Motivation

-   Use COVID-19 datasets to explore global pandemic stats

-   Explore relationships between COVID-19 prevalence and other datasets, e.g. mask policies, S&P500

# Data Wrangling - Strategy

-   Common data extraction scripts/functions across datasets

    -   Parallel processing

    -   Table extraction (scraping) from HTML using Selenium/readr

    -   Spark cluster interface

# Data Wrangling Milestones

-   Github API [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). Implemented [OAuth authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) to access Github via a personal account for higher limits.

-   OWID dataset did not provide latitude/longitude variables which would be handy for map plots. Downloaded a separate dataset with country lat/long and (left-)joined with OWID for plotting on

# Data Exploration - Strategy

-   Shiny for interactive data exploration

-   Leaflet for map displays

-   Spark for data analytics

# Tech Stack

-   **Rselenium**: chosen for it's headless browser capability and getting around potential issues with embedded JavaScript. Used to extract daily data URLs
-   **parallel**: chosen for efficiently processing remote data files using a local cluster
-   **readr**: reading remote/local CSVs
-   **leaflet**: render interactive global map
-   **Spark/sparklr**: proof-of-concept for performing EDAs on large datasets in a Spark cluster. Since cloud hosted Spark services are either fee-based or time-limited we used a local cluster
-   **AWS S3**: we looked into storing datasets on AWS S3 and leveraging Spark's built-in S3 connector. However, S3 storage rate-limits made this impractical (20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests each month)

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Combining the Covid and Mask Policy datasets

```{r}
# covid data
covid.url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himalayahall/DATA607-FINALPROJECT/master/data/processed/owid/owid-covid-data.csv"
covid <- read_csv(covid.url)

# face covering data
fc.url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himalayahall/DATA607-FINALPROJECT/master/data/source/face-covering-policies-covid.csv"
fc <- read.csv(fc.url)

# rename columns in fc data to match
# convert date to date
fc <- fc |>
  rename(date = Day, iso_code = Code, location = Entity) |>
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

# subset the covid data
covid.sub1 <- covid |> select(c(1:4,9,14,49,67))

kable(head(covid.sub1))
```

## Combining the Covid and Mask Policy datasets (cont'd)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
```{r}
# combine covid and face covering datasets
co.mask <- covid.sub1 |>
  left_join(fc, by=c("iso_code","location", "date"))

kable(head(co.mask))
```

## Face Covering Dataset
=======
# Face Covering Dataset
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Source: <https://ourworldindata.org/covid-face-coverings>

Countries are grouped into five categories:

0 = No policy\
1 = Recommended\
2 = Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible\
3 = Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible\
4 = Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people

# Face Covering Dataset (cont'd)

-   Aggregate - does not account for intra-country dynamics

-   Mask policy is typically in response to Covid outbreaks

# Avg. Mask Rates - Continent

# Avg. Mask Rates - G7

# Excess Deaths by Avg. Mask Policy

# Excess Deaths by Mask Policy

# Statistical Analysis

Does average mask policy predict total excess mortality?

The null hypothesis, $H_0$ - average mask policy *does not* predict total excess mortality. 

The alternative hypothesis, $H_A$ - average mask policy *does* predict total mortality. 

## Relationship Between Variables

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Subsetting Covid data by Shiny app
cols <- c('location',
          'total_deaths_per_million',
          'excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million',
          'hosp_patients_per_million',
          'total_cases_per_million',
          'positive_rate',
          'total_vaccinations_per_hundred',
          'population_density',
          'gdp_per_capita')

# face mask data subset
fc.sub <- fc |>
  select(c("location","facial_coverings"))

covid.sub1 <- covid |>
  select(all_of(cols)) |>
  na.omit() |>
  left_join(fc.sub, by="location")

# aggregate the data
covid.sub2 <- covid.sub1 |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarize(excess_mortality = max(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million),
            total_deaths = max(total_deaths_per_million),
            total_cases = max(total_cases_per_million),
            total_patients = max(hosp_patients_per_million),
            positive_rate = mean(positive_rate),
            total_vaccinations = max(total_vaccinations_per_hundred),
            pop_density = mean(population_density),
            gdp_per_capita = mean(gdp_per_capita),
            mask_policy = mean(facial_coverings))

ggpairs(covid.sub2[, 2:10])
```
## Fitting in a Linear Model

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(excess_mortality ~ mask_policy + pop_density + gdp_per_capita, covid.sub2)
summary(model.1)
```
With an adjusted R-squared of 0.4048, this model only accounts for 40% of the variance in excess mortality. Mask policy also vastly exceeds < 0.05 p-score for significance, so it is not a significant factor. 

## Improving the Model

```{r}
# dichotomous variable for mask policy below 2.5
ggplot(covid.sub2, aes(x=mask_policy)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = sqrt(nrow(covid.sub2))) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Avg. Mask Policy Scores")
```

## Improving the Model? (cont'd)

```{r}
mask <- covid.sub2 |>
  mutate(mask_policy = ifelse(mask_policy > mean(mask_policy), 1, 0))

# linear model utilizing dichotomous variable
model.2 <- lm(excess_mortality ~ mask_policy, mask)
plot(model.2)
```
