# Motivation

-   Use COVID-19 datasets to explore global pandemic stats

-   Explore relationships between COVID-19 prevalence and other datasets, e.g. mask policies, S&P500

# Data Acquisition - JHU CSSE [USA Daily Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us)

# Data Acquisition - JHU CSSE [Global timeseries](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

# Data Acquisition - [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

![OWID Comprehensive Timeseries](images/COVIDS-DAILY-OWID.PNG)

# Data Wrangling - Strategy

-   Common data extraction scripts/functions across datasets

    -   Parallel processing

    -   Table extraction (scraping) from HTML using Selenium/readr

    -   Spark cluster interface

# Data Wrangling Milestones

-   Github API [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). Implemented [OAuth authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) to access Github via a personal account for higher limits.

-   OWID dataset did not provide latitude/longitude variables. Downloaded a separate dataset with country lat/long and (left) joined with OWID for plotting on map

# Tech Stack

-   **Rselenium**: headless browser for getting around embedded JavaScript
-   **parallel**: chosen for efficiently processing remote data files using a local cluster
-   **readr**: reading remote/local CSVs
-   **Leaflet**: interactive global map
-   **Spark/sparklr**: proof-of-concept Spark cluster. Cloud hosted Spark services are fee-based or time-limited - used local cluster
-   **AWS S3**: AWS S3 rate-limits made it impractical (20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests each month)

# Face Covering Dataset

Source: <https://ourworldindata.org/covid-face-coverings>

Countries are grouped into five categories:

0 = No policy  
1 = Recommended  
2 = Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible  
3 = Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible  
4 = Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people  

# Face Covering Dataset (cont'd)

-   Aggregate - does not account for intra-country dynamics

-   Mask policy is typically in response to Covid outbreaks

# Avg. Mask Rates - Continent

![](images/AVG_MASK_CONTINENT.png)

# Avg. Mask Rates - G7

## Excess Deaths by Avg. Mask Policy

```{r}
# total excess deaths by avg mask policy
co.em <- co.mask |>
  filter(!is.na(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million)) |>
  select(1:4,7:10) |>
  rename(excess = excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million,
         face = facial_coverings) 

co.em |> na.omit() |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarize(total_excess = max(excess), avg_policy = mean(face)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=avg_policy, y=total_excess)) +
  geom_point()
```

## New Deaths by Mask Policy

```{r}
# subset new deaths
co.new <- co.mask |>
  filter(!is.na(new_deaths)) |>
  select(3,6,10) |>
  rename(mask_policy = facial_coverings)

# plot new deaths against mask policy
boxplot(new_deaths ~ mask_policy, co.new, main="distribution by policy", xlab="mask policy", ylab="new deaths")
```

# Statistical Analysis

Does average mask policy predict total excess mortality?

The null hypothesis, $H_0$ - average mask policy *does not* predict total excess mortality.

The alternative hypothesis, $H_A$ - average mask policy *does* predict total mortality.

## Relationship Between Variables

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Subsetting Covid data by Shiny app
cols <- c('location',
          'total_deaths_per_million',
          'excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million',
          'hosp_patients_per_million',
          'total_cases_per_million',
          'positive_rate',
          'total_vaccinations_per_hundred',
          'population_density',
          'gdp_per_capita')

# face mask data subset
fc.sub <- fc |>
  select(c("location","facial_coverings"))

covid.sub1 <- covid |>
  select(all_of(cols)) |>
  na.omit() |>
  left_join(fc.sub, by="location")

# aggregate the data
covid.sub2 <- covid.sub1 |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarize(excess_mortality = max(excess_mortality_cumulative_per_million),
            total_deaths = max(total_deaths_per_million),
            total_cases = max(total_cases_per_million),
            total_patients = max(hosp_patients_per_million),
            positive_rate = mean(positive_rate),
            total_vaccinations = max(total_vaccinations_per_hundred),
            pop_density = mean(population_density),
            gdp_per_capita = mean(gdp_per_capita),
            mask_policy = mean(facial_coverings))

ggpairs(covid.sub2[, 2:10])
```

## Fitting in a Linear Model

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(excess_mortality ~ mask_policy + pop_density + gdp_per_capita, covid.sub2)
summary(model.1)
```

With an adjusted R-squared of 0.4048, this model only accounts for 40% of the variance in excess mortality. Mask policy also vastly exceeds \< 0.05 p-score for significance, so it is not a significant factor.

## Improving the Model

```{r}
# dichotomous variable for mask policy below 2.5
ggplot(covid.sub2, aes(x=mask_policy)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = sqrt(nrow(covid.sub2))) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Avg. Mask Policy Scores")
```

## Improving the Model? (cont'd)

```{r}
mask <- covid.sub2 |>
  mutate(mask_policy = ifelse(mask_policy > mean(mask_policy), 1, 0))

# linear model utilizing dichotomous variable
model.2 <- lm(excess_mortality ~ mask_policy, mask)
plot(model.2)
```
