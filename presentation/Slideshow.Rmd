# Motivation

-   Use COVID-19 datasets to explore global pandemic stats

-   Explore relationships between COVID-19 prevalence and other datasets, e.g. mask policies, S&P500

# Data Acquisition - JHU CSSE [USA Daily Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us)

# Data Acquisition - JHU CSSE [Global timeseries](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

# Data Acquisition - [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

# Data Wrangling - Strategy

-   Common data extraction scripts/functions across datasets

    -   Parallel processing

    -   Table extraction (scraping) from HTML using Selenium/readr

    -   Spark cluster interface

# Data Wrangling Milestones

-   Github API [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). Implemented [OAuth authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) to access Github via a personal account for higher limits.

-   OWID dataset did not provide latitude/longitude variables. Downloaded a separate dataset with country lat/long and (left) joined with OWID for plotting on map

# Shiny - interactive data exploration

# Spark - distributed (Scalable) query, analytics, ML

# Tech Stack

-   **Rselenium**: headless browser for getting around embedded JavaScript
-   **parallel**: chosen for efficiently processing remote data files using a local cluster
-   **readr**: reading remote/local CSVs
-   **Leaflet**: interactive global map
-   **Spark/sparklr**: proof-of-concept Spark cluster. Cloud hosted Spark services are fee-based or time-limited - used local cluster
-   **AWS S3**: AWS S3 rate-limits made it impractical (20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests each month)

# Face Covering Dataset

Source: <https://ourworldindata.org/covid-face-coverings>

Countries are grouped into five categories:

0 = No policy  
1 = Recommended  
2 = Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible  
3 = Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible  
4 = Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people  

# Face Covering Dataset (cont'd)

-   Aggregate - does not account for intra-country dynamics

-   Mask policy is typically in response to Covid outbreaks

# Avg. Mask Rates - Continent

# Avg. Mask Rates - G7

# Excess Deaths by Avg. Mask Policy

![](images/EXCESS_POLICY_SCATTER.png)

# Excess Deaths by Mask Policy

![](images/EXCESS_POLICY_BOXPLOT.png)

# Statistical Analysis

Does average mask policy predict total excess mortality?

The null hypothesis, $H_0$ - average mask policy *does not* predict total excess mortality.

The alternative hypothesis, $H_A$ - average mask policy *does* predict total mortality.

# Relationship Between Mask Policy and Excess Death

# Fitting in a Linear Model

![](images/MODEL_1_CODE.png)

## Improving the Model

```{r}
# dichotomous variable for mask policy below 2.5
ggplot(covid.sub2, aes(x=mask_policy)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = sqrt(nrow(covid.sub2))) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Avg. Mask Policy Scores")
```

## Improving the Model? (cont'd)

```{r}
mask <- covid.sub2 |>
  mutate(mask_policy = ifelse(mask_policy > mean(mask_policy), 1, 0))

# linear model utilizing dichotomous variable
model.2 <- lm(excess_mortality ~ mask_policy, mask)
plot(model.2)
```
