# Motivation

- Use interesting COVID-19 data sets to visually explore the global prevalence of the pandemic

- Build distributed data pipelines to efficiently capture daily updates

- Explore Spark as the engine for distributed data analytics

- Use Shiny for interactive data exploration

# Data Acquisition Journey

- Started with USA [JHU CSSE Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Daily Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us)

- Added Global [JHU CSSE timeseries](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

- Added [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) to the data extraction pipeline 

# Data Wrangling Milestones

- We built and leveraged a set of common data extraction scripts/functions across all datasets. These include parallel processing, attribute extraction from HTML using Selenium, and Spark cluster interface. See [tech stack](https://github.com/himalayahall/DATA607-FINALPROJECT/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md#tech-stack-so-far) for details

- Ran into Github API [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). To get around rate limits we implemented [OAuth authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) to access Github via a personal account which enables higher limits.

- OWID dataset did not provide latitude/longitude variables which would be handy for map plots. We downloaded a separate dataset with country lat/long and (left-)joined with OWID for plotting on
