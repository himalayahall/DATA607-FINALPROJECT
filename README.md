## Ideas

1. Scrape Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us (Jawaid)
2. Use parallel processing to efficiently scrape data (Jawaid)
3. Enrich data - (a) economic indicators (income stats), (b) public policy indicators (school closures, mask/vaccination mandates in school and workplace), (c) demographics (race, gender, age), (d) other (?) (Josh)


5. Store data in Spark cluster (Jawaid)
6. EDA using Spark SQL (Josh and Jawaid)
