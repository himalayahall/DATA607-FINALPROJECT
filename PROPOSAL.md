This project will acquire and assess Covid-19 rates using data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, through web scraping using the selenium package in R, and parallel processing via a Spark cluster. We are currently investigating auxiliary data to determine a) interesting relationships to tie to covid rates, for example the presence/effect of face mask policies, or the S&P 500 over time, and b) whether to focus our analysis on the United States (state-to-state), or the World (country-to-country). These determinations will drive the project analysis.
