This project will acquire and assess Covid-19 rates using data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, acquired through web scraping utilizing the selenium package in R, and stored in a Spark cluster. We are currently investigating this data to determine whether to focus our analysis on the United States (state-to-state), or the World (country-to-country). This determination will drive the "enrichment" data we pursue to identify relationships between Covid-19 rates and predictors such as vaccination rates, economic status, voting trends, etc, on which we will subsequently perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling.
